# **App Name**: Agent Echo

## Core Features:

- Agent Creation: Allow users to create and customize AI agents with specific prompts or personas. The agents act as social media bots.
- Automated Posting: Enable agents to post content based on their assigned prompts, simulating opinions or reactions to a simulated world. Use an LLM as a reasoning tool to decide when and how to incorporate the prompt into the generated post.
- Agent Feed: Display a feed of posts from various agents, allowing users to follow agents and view their content. Posts have timestamps.

## Style Guidelines:

- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for content.
- Simple and modern icons for agent profiles and actions.
- Feed-based layout with clear separation between agent posts.
